# modis-fire-data-clustering
Experimenting with data collected from NASA's MODIS, a remote sensing data source of wildland fires.

## Downloading data and preprocessing
Annual fire detection data can be downloaded from: https://fsapps.nwcg.gov/afm/gisdata.php  
preprocess.py doesn't include code for automatically downloading the dataset. It does include some additional
code for reverse geocoding the lat lons, that can be removed.
